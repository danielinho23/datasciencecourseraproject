===========================================================================================================================

This data summarizes the means and standard deviations for each variable taking into account two general groups (activity and subject).

===========================================================================================================================

1. It was transformed in tidy data the TRAINING and TESTING ones.
2. The features.txt was used to assign the column names of both tables mentioned above.
3. Merge TRAINING and TESTING data frames into one.
4. There were selected just the variables who store information related to the mean and standard deviation.
5. It was applied a descriptive method based on the labels_activity_txt file.
6. The variables (columns) were renamed in order make them more understandable.

============================================================================================

The project includes:

- README.md: General project description
- CoderBook.md: Variables used inside the code (script)
- Data Frame (the result after running the code)
- run_analysis.R: Script to reproduce the cleanning process

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

For each record it is provided:
Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
